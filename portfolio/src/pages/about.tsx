          I'm a Junior Software Developer with a background in nursing and a passion for building web applications that make a difference. I recently completed an intensive full-stack bootcamp, gaining hands-on experience in modern technologies like React, TypeScript, Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB.
          <br /><br />
          I enjoy solving problems, collaborating with others, and continuously learning. My transition from healthcare to tech gives me a unique perspective on empathy-driven design and user-centric development.
